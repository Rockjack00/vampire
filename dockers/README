Look at the all script to work out the order in which to run things

The all script takes the number of workers as input, 0 means parallel setup, >0 means cloud setup

IMPORTANT: The AWS file needs to be filled in with your account id, which matches what you have in your ~/.aws/credentials (or you set some other way)

You may also want to update where you put https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-batch-comp-infrastructure-sample

After you've run all for the first time you don't need to setup again, you can call switch_to_X to change the setup from cloud to parallel
